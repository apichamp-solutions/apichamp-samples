# APIchamp Sample Pets

This is a sample configuration for an APIchamp instance showcasing three API endpoints related to pets. The instance is set up to manage data from a PostgreSQL database using basic authentication for added security.

## Endpoints

1. `GET /pets`: Retrieves a list of pets from the database. Optionally, you can use the `limit` query parameter to specify the number of pets to fetch. The response is mapped to the `Pet` model.

2. `POST /pets`: Creates a new pet record in the database using data provided in the request body. The response contains details about the created pet, retrieved through the `getPet` fulfillment. The response is mapped to the `Pet` model.

3. `GET /pets/{petId}`: Retrieves details of a specific pet identified by `petId` from the database. The response is mapped to the `Pet` model.

## Authentication

Basic authentication is enabled for this instance. You must provide the correct username and password (`demo` and `demo`, respectively) in the request headers to access the APIs.

## Data Source

The instance is connected to a PostgreSQL database (`postdb`) using the provided URL, username, and password.

## Debug Mode

Debug mode is enabled, allowing you to test and debug your endpoints using the Swagger page at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

Feel free to customize this configuration to suit your specific use case and data source. Happy APIchamp-ing! ðŸš€
