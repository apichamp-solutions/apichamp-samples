## Requirements: 
- [Docker Client](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

## Getting Started

Open the terminal or your shell and run the following command:

```docker-compose up```

This command will not only launch the APICHAMP Docker container but also provide a demo
data source. Once the container is up and running, you can begin testing your API by visiting:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## Endpoints

1. `GET /products`: Retrieves a list of products from the database. You can filter products by specifying the `category` query parameter. The response is mapped to the `ProductModel` model.

## Data Source

The instance is connected to a MariaDB database (`demodb`) using the provided URL, username, and password.

## Debug Mode

Debug mode is enabled, allowing you to test and debug your endpoints using the Swagger page at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

Feel free to customize this configuration to suit your specific use case and data source. Happy APICHAMP-ing! ðŸš€
